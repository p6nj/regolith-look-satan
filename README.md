# regolith-look Satan
Satan theme for the Regolith desktop environment.  

You need the [Ubuntu-Mono-Dark-Red](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1971791/) Gnome theme for icons and a satanic background to put at `/usr/share/backgrounds/regolith-satan.jpg`. For PNGs or other formats, you can edit the background picture path in the `root` file.  

I use the Firefox browser with some satanic theme and the [Dark Background Light Text extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/dark-background-light-text/) with these colors:
```
#ff0000
#000000
#FF8888
#dc8add
#a51d2d
#FF0000
```
